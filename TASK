Task is:

Read a CSV file, containing three columns and a header row.

name,integer,float
Foxtrot,6,0.657

Multiply the two numbers together, then print output, one per line, like:
printf("%s is %.02f") where %s is the first column and %f is the result of the
multiplication.

Time how long it takes, starting from before you open the file to read.
ie. To time almost everything in the program, except the start-up cost of the
interpreter, JVM, etc.
